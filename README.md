# 🌟 Face Beauty Assessment

Welcome to the **Face Beauty Assessment** project! This Python application uses computer vision techniques to evaluate facial features and provide a beauty score based on various criteria. 

## 🚀 Features
- **👁️ Real-time Face Detection**: Utilizes Haar Cascade classifiers to detect faces, eyes, and smiles.
- **🏆 Beauty Scoring**: Calculates a beauty score based on symmetry, brightness, and feature detection (eyes, smile, mouth, profile).
- **✨ Enhanced Features**: Applies enhancements to facial features for improved aesthetics.
- **🖱️ User Interaction**: Allows users to either exit or retake the assessment after viewing the results.
- **📸 Snapshots**: Saves enhanced facial images for review.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **🐍 Python**: The main programming language.
- **🔍 OpenCV**: Library for computer vision tasks.
- **📊 Numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **🔗 Haar Cascades**: Pre-trained models for detecting faces and features.

   cd Face_beauty_rating
   ```

2. **Install required packages**:
   Make sure you have Python and pip installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy
   ```

3. **Download Haar Cascade XML files**:
   Download the necessary Haar Cascade files and place them in the project directory:
   - [haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades)
   - [haarcascade_eye.xml](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades)
   - [haarcascade_smile.xml](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades)
   - [haarcascade_eye_tree_eyeglasses.xml](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades)
   - [haarcascade_profileface.xml](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades)
   - [haarcascade_mcs_mouth.xml](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades)

4. **Run the application**:
   Execute the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python face_looks_max.py
   ```

## 🎯 Usage
- Launch the application and allow access to your webcam.
- The application will run for **30 seconds**, during which it will assess your facial features.
- After the evaluation, view your beauty score and feature ratings.
- Choose to **exit** or **retake** the assessment.

## 📄 Code Overview
Here's a brief overview of the main components of the code:

- **Face Detection**: Utilizes Haar Cascade for detecting faces and facial features.
- **Feature Rating Calculation**: Calculates ratings for eyes, smiles, mouths, and profiles based on detections.
- **Beauty Score Calculation**: Combines various metrics to generate a final beauty score.
- **User Interaction**: Prompts the user to either exit or retake the assessment after results are displayed.
